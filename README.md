# 1. Introduction

This document is a collection of profiles that define integration of
authentication services with ISO 8583 used for financial transactions (e.g.,
point-of-sale (POS), automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawal
transactions, etc.). Such services include biometric authentication (as defined
by IEEE Std. 2410), PIN-based, Fast Identity Online (FIDO), and One-Time
Password (OTP) and Time-based OTP (TOTP) authentication methods including risk
and presentation attack defense (PAD) measures. The scope of authentication
includes primary authentication, second-factor authentication (2FA), step-up
authentication (SUA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

Create a collection of standard profiles that define integration of
authentication services with ISO 8583 used for financial transactions
(e.g., point-of-sale (POS), automated teller machine (ATM) cash
withdrawal transactions, etc.). Such services include biometric
authentication (as defined by IEEE Std. 2410), PIN-based, Fast
Identity Online (FIDO), and One-Time Password (OTP) and Time-based OTP
(TOTP) authentication methods including risk and presentation attack
defense (PAD) measures. The scope of authentication includes primary
